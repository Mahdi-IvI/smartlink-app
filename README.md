The SmartLink Guest App is designed to enhance the guest experience in hotels and student accommodations by providing a seamless way to access rooms, communicate with management, and stay updated with the latest news and notifications. The app supports both English and German languages and offers a variety of features to ensure convenience and security for guests.

##Features 

1.  Introduction Page

The introduction page consists of three sub-pages that welcome guests to the app and highlight its key features. It provides a brief overview of how the app can be used to manage guest services and access rooms.

2.  Login Page

Guests can log in using their Gmail accounts. The login process involves selecting a Gmail account, after which the app fetches the necessary details and logs the user in securely.

3. Home Page

The home page displays the main functionalities of the app. It includes an app drawer that shows the guest’s profile picture, email address, and the places they have access to. From here, guests can navigate to various sections of the app, such as:

	•	Open Doors
	•	Contact Us
	•	Chat Room
	•	Ticket
	•	News

4. Door Opener Page

This page allows guests to open or lock doors they have access to. For added security, guests must verify their fingerprint before accessing the door controls. Each door is represented by a button, and tapping a button prompts a fingerprint verification before the door is opened or locked.

5. Contact Page

The contact page provides detailed information about the accommodation (hotel or student residence). It includes the address, phone numbers, email addresses, website links, and social media handles. Guests can click on the address to open a map app for directions.

6. Chatroom Page

The chatroom page is primarily for student residences, allowing students to chat with each other. The interface displays the chat history and provides an input field for sending messages.

7. Ticket Page

Guests can view their previous tickets and create new ones. The page displays a list of existing tickets, and guests can click on a ticket to open a chat interface with the management. A + button allows guests to create new tickets by entering the subject and description.

8. News Page

The news page displays the latest news and updates from the accommodation. Guests can read announcements and stay informed about important events and changes.

9. Available Places Page

If a guest does not have access to any places, the home page displays the available places. Guests can view details about each place and, if needed, retrieve their personal code to request access from the management.
